# Hangman game

#### Play with a friend, or against the computer!

Built as a personal project in summer 2019 whilst self-learning web development, using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### Features:

- Game loads with certain features and buttons disabled
- Either enter your own word for a friend to guess
- Or let the game generate a random word (hard mode!)
- Once game has begun, it must be reset before a new game can be started
- Guess letters by clicking on the letter buttons
- The player is given visual indication whether the guess is right or wrong
- When all the guesses have been used up, the game is locked and must be reset
